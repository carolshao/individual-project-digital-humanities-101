## Abstract

In recent years, the fast progress of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning has led to a new type of media manipulation called deepfakes. Deepfakes are videos altered by AI to replace a person’s face with someone else’s, creating very realistic footage that can be hard to distinguish from real videos. This technology has caught the attention of researchers, the media, and the public due to its potential for misuse, such as spreading false information, swaying public opinion, or creating non-consensual pornographic content. As deepfakes become more advanced and accessible, it is crucial to understand how people view and interact with this technology.

YouTube, a major video-sharing platform, offers a wealth of data to explore audience reactions and opinions on deepfake videos. With billions of active users each month and a wide range of content, YouTube has become a central place for discussions on various topics, including deepfakes. The platform’s comment section allows users to share their thoughts, opinions, and reactions to the videos they watch, creating a valuable record of public sentiment and discourse.

This project aims to address a gap in current deepfake research, which has mainly focused on the technical side of their creation and detection, as well as legal and ethical issues. By examining YouTube comments, this project takes a novel approach to understanding the social aspects of deepfakes from the audience’s perspective. The specific research question is: What are the main themes, sentiments, and opinions found in YouTube comments on deepfake videos, and how do they reflect public views and attitudes towards deepfakes?

Data for this project is gathered using the YouTube Data API to extract comments from a diverse range of deepfake videos. The comments are analyzed using natural language processing (NLP) techniques, including sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and named entity recognition. The findings provide insights into public perceptions and engagement with deepfakes, contributing to the broader understanding of the social impact of this technology.
